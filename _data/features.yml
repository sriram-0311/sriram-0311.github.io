  excerpt: "We present a multi-sensor fusion system for autonomous vehicle navigation, developed in collaboration with the Toyota Research Institute. Our approach integrates visual-inertial odometry with GPS data to generate sparse yet accurate environmental maps, enabling precise heading estimation for downstream control tasks. The system's core comprises a multi-camera setup coupled with an IMU and GPS, a robust Visual Place Recognition module with loop closure capabilities, and an efficient factor graph optimization framework. To enhance computational efficiency in large-scale environments, we implement a reduced camera model with an elimination procedure analogous to the Schur complement. Post-mapping, we introduce a global relocalization and tracking system that adapts to varying environmental conditions, employing a two-stage approach for coarse localization and fine-grained pose estimation. This comprehensive system demonstrates robust performance across diverse scenarios, providing a solid foundation for autonomous navigation in complex, real-world environments."

- title: "Panoptic Segmentation"
  excerpt: "Our project leverages the <b>DETR model</b> for panoptic segmentation in computer vision. We adapt DETRs architecture for accurate 'stuff' and 'things' class distinction and fine-tune it on Cityscapes datasets. Our focus is on real-time applications and robust evaluation metrics like panoptic quality. By optimizing for challenging scenarios, our work aims to advance scene understanding in autonomous driving, extend this model towards Video Panoptic Segmentation."

- title: "Removing Motion Blur"
  excerpt: "Deblurring images is challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Traditional methods rely on informative priors, but this paper suggests learning them from the data. By focusing on motion flow maps, a Fully Convolutional Neural Network can effectively recover images. Synthetic data with simulated flows aids in calculating blur kernels for non-blind deconvolution, enhancing image recovery."

- title: "Image Mosaicing and Warping"
  excerpt: "This project aims to stitch multiple images together to form a panorama. The process involves feature detection, feature matching, and image warping. The feature detection algorithm used is the Harris Corner Detector. The feature matching algorithm used is the brute force matcher. The image warping algorithm used is the inverse distance weighted interpolation."

- title: "Motion Detection"
  excerpt: "In Computer Vision it is often helpful to discard unnecessary parts of images to focus only on essential sections. In the case of doing an analysis of dynamic objects in a static environment, removing the static background and detecting the moving objects can provide an excellent first step. In this project multiple spatial and temporal filtering techniques are implemented in C++ to detect motion in image sequences with static backgrounds. In particular, absolute difference and Prewitt temporal masking are implemente and compared to a derivative of a gaussian filter."

- title: "Mobile Robotics Project"
  excerpt: "We designed a robot for environment mapping and April tag recognition, this included writing the custom code for mapping from Laser scans, using frontier exploration. Our work included custom mapping modules and a novel approach for camera-to-1D lidar calibration, a challenging problem due to the lidar's dimensionality. Leveraging linear algebra, we solved a non-linear least-square optimization problem, significantly reducing calibration errors."
